"""
X is a numpy.ndarray of shape (n, d) containing the data set
kmin is a positive integer containing
the minimum number of clusters to check for (inclusive)
kmax is a positive integer containing
the maximum number of clusters to check for (inclusive)
iterations is a positive integer containing
the maximum number of iterations for the EM algorithm
tol is a non-negative float containing the tolerance for the EM algorithm
verbose is a boolean that determines if the EM algorithm should print
information to the standard output
Returns:
best_k is the best value for k based on its BIC
best_result is tuple containing pi, m, S
pi is a numpy.ndarray of shape (k,)
containing the cluster priors for the best number of clusters
m is a numpy.ndarray of shape (k, d)
containing the centroid means for the best number of clusters
S is a numpy.ndarray of shape (k, d, d)
containing the covariance matrices for the best number of clusters
l is a numpy.ndarray of shape (kmax - kmin + 1)
containing the log likelihood for each cluster size tested
b is a numpy.ndarray of shape (kmax - kmin + 1)
containing the BIC value for each cluster size tested
Use: BIC = p * ln(n) - 2 * l
p is the number of parameters required for the model
n is the number of data points used to create the model
l is the log likelihood of the model"""
