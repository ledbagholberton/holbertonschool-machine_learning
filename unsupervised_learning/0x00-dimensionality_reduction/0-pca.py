Write a function that performs PCA on a dataset
X is a numpy.ndarray of shape (n, d) where:
n is the number of data points
d is the number of dimensions in each point
all dimensions have a mean of 0 across all data points
var is the fraction of the variance that the PCA transformation
should maintain:
Returns: the weights matrix, W, that maintains var fraction of
Xâ€˜s original variance
W is a numpy.ndarray of shape (d, nd) where nd is the new
