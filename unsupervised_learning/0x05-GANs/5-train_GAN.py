"""
X is a np.ndarray of shape (m, 784) containing the real data input
m is the number of real data samples
epochs is the number of epochs that the each network should be trained for
batch_size is the batch size that should be used during training
Z_dim is the number of dimensions for the randomly generated input
save_path is the path to save the trained generator
Create the tf.placeholder for Z and add it to the graphâ€™s collection
The discriminator and generator training should be altered after one epoch
