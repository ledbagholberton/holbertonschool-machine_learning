"""
Observation is a numpy.ndarray of shape (T,) that contains the index of the
observation
T is the number of observations
Emission is a numpy.ndarray of shape (N, M) containing the emission probability
of a specific observation given a hidden state
Emission[i, j] is the probability of observing j given the hidden state i
N is the number of hidden states
M is the number of all possible observations
Transition is a 2D numpy.ndarray of shape (N, N) containing the transition
probabilities
Transition[i, j] is the probability of transitioning from
the hidden state i to j
Initial a numpy.ndarray of shape (N, 1) containing the probability of starting
in a particular hidden state
Returns: P, F, or None, None on failure
P is the likelihood of the observations given the model
F is a numpy.ndarray of shape (N, T) containing the forward path probabilities
F[i, j] is the probability of being in hidden state i at time j given the
previous observations
