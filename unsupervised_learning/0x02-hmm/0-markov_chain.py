"""
P is a square 2D numpy.ndarray of shape (n, n) representing
the transition matrix
P[i, j] is the probability of transitioning from state i to state j
n is the number of states in the markov chain
s is a numpy.ndarray of shape (1, n) representing
the probability of starting in each state
t is the number of iterations that the markov chain has been through
Returns: a numpy.ndarray of shape (1, n) representing
probability of being in a specific state after t iterations, or None on failure
