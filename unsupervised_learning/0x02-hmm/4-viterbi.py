"""
Observation is a numpy.ndarray of shape (T,) that contains
the index of the observation
T is the number of observations
Emission is a numpy.ndarray of shape (N, M) containing
the emission probability of a specific observation given a hidden state
Emission[i, j] is the probability of observing j given the hidden state i
N is the number of hidden states
M is the number of all possible observations
Transition is a 2D numpy.ndarray of shape (N, N) containing
the transition probabilities
Transition[i, j] is probability of transitioning from the hidden state i to j
Initial a numpy.ndarray of shape (N, 1) containing
the probability of starting in a particular hidden state
Returns: path, P, or None, None on failure
path is the a list of length T containing
the most likely sequence of hidden states
P is the probability of obtaining the path sequence
